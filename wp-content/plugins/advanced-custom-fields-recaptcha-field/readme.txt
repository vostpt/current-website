Prevent spam on your Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) v5 frontend forms with Google reCAPTCHA.

== Description ==

ACF reCAPTCHA brings Google reCAPTCHA to [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/), to be used on frontend forms.

Features include:

* *ACF reCAPTCHA Protection* ensures that spambots cannot circumvent reCAPTCHA to submit forms on the server-side
* ACF-compliant client-side validation which prompts the user if reCAPTCHA is not clicked or had expired
* Customizable reCAPTCHA options, including theme (light/dark), type (image/audio) and size (normal/compact)
* Compatible with ACF Conditional Logic feature, which allows hiding/showing certain fields until the reCAPTCHA has been passed

For more detailed setup instructions, or to report an issue, please head over to the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/irvinlim/acf-recaptcha).

= ACF Frontend Forms =

ACF reCAPTCHA is meant to be used **only on frontend forms**, in order to protect them from spam by spambots.

To create a frontend form programmatically, please view the official documentation on the ACF website [here](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/create-a-front-end-form/).

= ACF Compatibility =

ACF reCAPTCHA is currently only compatible with ACF v5 at the moment. If you would like to help to add support for v4, do submit a PR on GitHub.

== Installation ==
In order to use ACF reCAPTCHA, you need to generate your reCAPTCHA API keys for your domain at the [Google reCAPTCHA Dashboard](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin) first.

1. In the ACF field group edit page, click *Add Field* to add a new field.
2. Find the *reCAPTCHA* field type under *Custom*.
3. Enter your site key and secret key that was generated previously.
4. *(optional)* Configure the theme, size and type of the reCAPTCHA widget.
5. **Important**: Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and enable *ACF reCAPTCHA Protection* for the field group.

== Screenshots ==
1. ACF reCAPTCHA customization in the ACF backend page. Enter your site and secret keys here.
2. ACF reCAPTCHA Protection toggle under Field Group Settings. Use this to ensure that your forms are fully protected against spambots.
3. Example frontend form with ACF reCAPTCHA used with Conditional Logic. The textarea is only displayed when the reCAPTCHA is solved.
